## Testbench Folder

This is a folder for keeping all top level or more advanced testing in. Simple module level testbenches can be found in each moudle's .sv file under the module. 
For this project, I only have one toplevel testbench that is used for checking correct connections. 
In larger projects, this would be a good place to have different testbenches that exercise combinations of submodules or different toplevel tests.
